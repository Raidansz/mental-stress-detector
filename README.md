# Simple ECG Stress Detection

A basic example using synthetic ECG data to demonstrate the process of detecting stress from ECG signals.

## Files:
- `data_generation.py`: Contains functions to generate and visualize synthetic ECG data.
- `train_model.py`: Contains the code to train a basic SVM classifier to distinguish between stressed and not-stressed ECG signals.

## Usage:
1. Run `data_generation.py` to visualize synthetic ECG samples.
2. Run `train_model.py` to train the classifier and evaluate its performance.
